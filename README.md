# BATTLESHIPS
## ENCE260 Assignment 2 by Morgan Lee (mle150) and Kaden Adlington (kad112)

This is a simple copy of the popular board game, Battleships, that you can play on the UC FunKit4.
In addition to the traditional battleships gameplay, this version introduces a few new attack options. Every 3rd turn you will be able to attack your opponent with a torpedo that will hit every space in a single column and then every 6th turn you will be able to attack your opponent with a larger bomb attack that will hit every space in a 3 by 3 square.
